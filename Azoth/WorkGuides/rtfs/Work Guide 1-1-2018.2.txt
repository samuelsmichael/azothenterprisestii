<topractice>Try to replace the constant use of the word &ldquo;I&rdquo; with &ldquo;some part of myself&rdquo; or &ldquo;part of me.&rdquo; When you are caught up in some identification and the &ldquo;fixing feature&rdquo; engages, can you relax and accept the slavery of that moment. Try to sense and feel that it is &ldquo;yourself&rdquo; that experiences the limitations of the parts&rsquo; identification.
