Day dreaming is absolutely the opposite of &ldquo;useful&rdquo; mental activity. &ldquo;Useful&rdquo; in this case means activity directed towards a definite aim and undertaken for the sake of obtaining a definite result. Daydreaming does not pursue any aim, does not strive after any result. The motive for daydreaming always lies in the emotional or in the moving center.<br />
