Every ceremony, if it continues to be practiced without change, has value. Ritual is like ancient dances which were guide books where truth was written down. But to understand one must have a key. A ceremony is a book in which much is written. Anyone who understands can read it. In one ceremony more is contained than a hundred books. Usually everything changes, but customs and ceremonies can remain unchanged.<br />
