<topractice>Try this exercise before getting out of bed in the morning or before falling asleep at night. While lying quietly, 
breathe in slowly with your attention on your solar plexus, and your wish to be. Experience the feeling of &ldquo;I&rdquo;. 
When you slowly exhale, move your attention to your spine, while sensing the weight of the body. Experience the sensation of &ldquo;AM&rdquo;. Repeat this for three breaths.</topractice>
