<ponderence>Sacrifice is necessary. If nothing is sacrificed nothing is obtained. And it is necessary to sacrifice something precious at the moment, to sacrifice for a long time and to sacrifice a great deal. But still, not forever... when crystallization is achieved, renunciations, privations, and sacrifices are no longer necessary. Then a man may have everything he wants.</ponderence>

<topractice>On February 14, Ash Wednesday, the Christian fast of Lent begins. Gurdjieff advised in Tales, not consuming meat, fish or 
dairy during this period to help prevent respiratory infections. Although this is a demanding sacrifice (vegan for 47 days), 
and not for everyone, still it can be useful during a time when so many people around the world are sacrificing, to renounce something. 
Pick a sacrifice for yourself (keep it manageable) and try to hold to it until Easter. Also, keep it to yourself, between you and the Higher, until after the fast is over.
