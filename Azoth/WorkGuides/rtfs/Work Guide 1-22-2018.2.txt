<ponderence>Every ceremony, if it continues to be practiced without change, has value. Ritual is like ancient dances which were guide books where truth was written down. But to understand one must have a key. A ceremony is a book in which much is written. Anyone who understands can read it. In one ceremony more is contained than a hundred books. Usually everything changes, but customs and ceremonies can remain unchanged.</ponderence>

<topractice>Lord Pentland used to ask John Fuchs, &ldquo;Do you have any rituals in your life?&rdquo; John shared this in several work 
groups over the years and put the question to the group in the same way. 
&ldquo;Do I have any rituals in my life?&rdquo; Ponder this carefully (e.g., prayer, sitting, movements, making the bed in the morning, etc.), 
and if you have no rituals, can you begin one? Keep it simple and consistent.</topractice>
