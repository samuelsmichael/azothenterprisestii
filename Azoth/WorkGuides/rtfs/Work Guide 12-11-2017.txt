Identifying is the chief obstacle to self-remembering. In order to learn not to identify man must first of all not be identified with himself, must not call himself &ldquo;I&rdquo; always and on all occasions. He must remember that there are two in him, that there is himself, that is &ldquo;I&rdquo; in him, and another with whom he must struggle and whom he must conquer.<br />
