The devil is a fearsome character, but without him you couldn't work. Mr. Gurdjieff used to say, &ldquo;Oh, la, la! Fine gentleman. Always eager to please, obliging... doesn't miss a trick. Not a single one! He's on top of everything. Really everything! Nothing, absolutely nothing escapes him.&rdquo;<br />
