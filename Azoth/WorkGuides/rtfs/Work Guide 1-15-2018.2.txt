<ponderence>Now we are speaking about love for life. Wherever there is life (plants, animals) there is love. Each life is a representation of God. Whoever can see the representative will see Him who is represented. Every life is sensitive to love... Whoever does not love life does not love God.</ponderence>

<topractice>At the end of the above reading, Gurdjieff gives the exercise &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; to work on the feelings. Take the time at least once a day to try this 
exercise and see if you can make contact with your being functions (feeling/sensing). See if you can find an 
appreciation and gratitude for your own life.</topractice>
