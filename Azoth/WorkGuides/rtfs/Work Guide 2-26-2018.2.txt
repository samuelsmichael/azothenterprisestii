<ponderence>Day dreaming is absolutely the opposite of &ldquo;useful&rdquo; mental activity. &ldquo;Useful&rdquo; in this case means activity directed towards a definite aim and undertaken for the sake of obtaining a definite result. Daydreaming does not pursue any aim, does not strive after any result. The motive for daydreaming always lies in the emotional or in the moving center.</ponderence>

<topractice>In the above reading, John provides an exercise to help concentrate the thinking attention. It is indicated in the 
footnote on page 74. In addition to this exercise, you can also do a counting in two directions exercise. 
Start with the numbers 1 and 100, then 2 and 99, then 3 and 98, and so on, until completing the sequence. 
If you catch your mind daydreaming, try either of these two exercises.</topractice>
