Sacrifice is necessary. If nothing is sacrificed nothing is obtained. And it is necessary to sacrifice something precious at the moment, to sacrifice for a long time and to sacrifice a great deal. But still, not forever... when crystallization is achieved, renunciations, privations, and sacrifices are no longer necessary. Then a man may have everything he wants.<br />
