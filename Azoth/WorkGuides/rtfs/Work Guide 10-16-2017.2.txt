<ponderence>&ldquo;...not one of you has noticed that you do not remember yourselves. You do not feel yourselves; you are not conscious of yourselves. With you, &ldquo;it observes&rdquo; just as &ldquo;it speaks,&rdquo; &ldquo;it thinks,&rdquo; &ldquo;it laughs.&rdquo; You do not feel: I observe, I notice, I see. Everything still &ldquo;is noticed,&rdquo; &ldquo;is seen.&rdquo; In order really to observe oneself one must first of all remember oneself.</ponderence>
