<topractice>During your day on the job, prepare for any short exchange (i.e. a talk with a client or boss, lunch with a co-worker, a necessary dialogue with a difficult person, etc.) and intentionally choose a role to play with this person. 
While in character, keep your body relaxed and your inner attitude neutral. Keep it short and if you lose your attention, try again.</topractice>
