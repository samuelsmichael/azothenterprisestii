<ponderence>There are two methods of self-observation: analysis, or attempts at analysis, that is, attempts to find the answers to the questions: upon what does a certain thing depend, and why does it happen; and the second method is registering, simply &ldquo;recording&rdquo; in one&rsquo;s mind what is observed at the moment.</ponderence>
