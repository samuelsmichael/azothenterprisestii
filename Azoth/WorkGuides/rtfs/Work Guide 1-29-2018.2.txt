<topractice>Remember that effort influenced by necessity or desire is no effort. To remember oneself is effort, 
because no external shock can force us. Effort is for the sake of consciousness. To struggle with our habits gives only a taste of effort. 
Self-remembering helps to balance centers, changes chemical processes and improves nutrition. Personality wants and essence wishes. 
See if you can try to connect with your essence wish to remember yourself.
